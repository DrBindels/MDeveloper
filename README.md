MDeveloper can be used for predicting distillate flux and condenser outlet temperature in pilot-scale V-AGMD. 
Trained on a comprehensive dataset of over 2,700 datapoints, MDeveloper exhibited robust model fit, with an RMSE of 0.23 L/m2h for distillate flux and 0.75 ˚C for condenser outlet temperature.
